        <h2>Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)</h2>
        <p>
          Launched on 1st July, 2015 with the motto of 'Har Khet Ko Paani', the
          Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) is being implemented to
          expand cultivated area with assured irrigation, reduce wastage of
          water and improve water use efficiency. PMKSY not only focuses on
          creating sources for assured irrigation, but also creating protective
          irrigation by harnessing rain water at micro level through 'Jal
          Sanchay' and 'Jal Sinchan'. Micro irrigation is also incentivized
          through subsidy to ensure 'Per drop-More crop'. The target under
          micro-irrigation for the year 2016-17 was 8 lakh ha. against which
          8.39 lakh ha have been covered.
